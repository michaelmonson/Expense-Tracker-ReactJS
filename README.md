# Expense Tracker (built with ReactJS)

A test project that I have created while learning ReactJS through a Udemy development course.

This will cover a lot of the ReactJS basics that I am learning, including components

- Explore many of the base features that make up React, and all of the core syntax.
- Learn how to build component-driven user interfaces by embracing a concept called components.
- Discover how we can build our own components with React, and how we can use them and work with them.
- Working with data in React Applications, and changing and updating views.
- Introduce a feature called JSX which uses a special syntax.

Web Components are embraced by React.  Learn how we can work with data in React apps, because most web applications do not show static text, but outputs and displays dynamic data that is updated when things change on the screen.
